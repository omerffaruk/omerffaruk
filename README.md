- 👋 Hi, I’m @omerffaruk. You may call me Omer. I am a keen programming learner. My programming journey has started with the Code Your Future (a community/coding school). 
In order to be accepted by the Code Your Future, I was needed to build websites with basic HTML and CSS. Once I submitted my application, I researched about platforms and 
courses that I can self-teach myself about JavaScript. My purpose was to ensure I would be ready for the Code Your Future interview, and if accepted, also for the 8 months 
full-stack course. My research led me to CodeCademy. Their annual subscription seemed a good option to me since they offer many courses for beginners. 
So I started learning vanilla JavaScript on CodeCademy. In the meantime, my application to Code Your Future was accepted, and I have started the course. I am now attending the 
Code Your Future fundamental course and also continue learning on CodeCademy. 

- 👀 I’m particularly interested in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks. The feedback I have received has convinced me to focus on one particular area as a new learner. I would
like to strengthen my knowledge with JavaScript projects. I will regularly share my CodeCademy projects on GitHub so that I could trace my progress, and also receive your valuable
feedback. Please feel free to comment on my projects, they are appreciated. Other than the course and self-teaching JavaScript, I am learning about blockchain technology. I have a 
major interest in the technology that powers cryptocurrencies. I have realized that blockchain is more than cryptocurrencies and they carry the potential to revolutionize our 
life in the close future. I would be glad to hear your opinions about this topic. 

- 💞️ I would be pleased to be of help on your JavaScript projects. Although I have a fresh beginner, I would like to help with all my capacity. Hopefully, along this thrilling
road, I will be of help more. 

- 🌱 Personally, I like playing (and watching) soccer and basketball, cycling, running, learning a language, reading books, watching films, learning about investment, playing
a musical instrument and surely programming.
